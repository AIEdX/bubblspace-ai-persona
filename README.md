### About Ultravox

Bubblspace leverages Ultravox, a groundbreaking multimodal LLM that directly processes human speech without requiring a separate Audio Speech Recognition (ASR) stage. Key features include:

- **Direct Speech Understanding**: Processes audio directly into LLM-compatible high-dimensional space
- **Multiple Model Support**: Trained versions available for Llama 3, Mistral, and Gemma
- **Fast Response Time**: Outperforms traditional ASR+LLM pipeline systems
- **Future Capabilities**: Will understand paralinguistic cues like timing and emotion

Our implementation uses the Llama 3.3 70B model by default, with an 8B variant available on Hugging Face. Ultravox's architecture allows for training against any open-weight model, making it highly adaptable for various use cases.
