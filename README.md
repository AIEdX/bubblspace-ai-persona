# About

Bubblspace-persona-ai is a revolutionary speech-to-speech pipeline for building voice-enabled AI personas. This repository provides the complete toolkit needed to create natural conversational AI agents that can both understand and generate speech.

At its core, bubblspace-persona-ai takes either audio or text input and generates natural-sounding audio output, enabling truly fluid conversations with AI agents. Built on a groundbreaking multimodal LLM architecture, it can process both text and human speech directly without requiring a separate Audio Speech Recognition (ASR) stage.

Bubblspace is a groundbreaking multi-AI agent platform that transforms single documents into various interactive AI experiences. Built on advances in multimodal AI (including Ultravox for voice capabilities), our system enables:

- **Document Transformation**: Convert one document into multiple AI-powered formats
- **Voice-Enabled AI Personas**: Natural audio conversations with AI agents
- **Enterprise Integration**: Seamless deployment in business environments

### Key Features

- **MicroLearning modules**: Convert documents into bite-sized learning experiences
- **Usecase/Story Generation**: Create interactive scenarios and stories

Bubblspace is a fork of Ultravox, a groundbreaking multimodal LLM that directly processes human speech without requiring a separate Audio Speech Recognition (ASR) stage. 

- **Direct Speech Understanding**: Processes audio directly into LLM-compatible high-dimensional space
- **Multiple Model Support**: Trained versions available for Deepseek
- **Fast Response Time**: Outperforms traditional ASR+LLM pipeline systems
- **Future Capabilities**: Will understand paralinguistic cues like timing and emotion
- **Speech-to-Speech Pipeline**: Complete pipeline for building voice-enabled AI models

Our implementation uses the Deepseek models by default.
